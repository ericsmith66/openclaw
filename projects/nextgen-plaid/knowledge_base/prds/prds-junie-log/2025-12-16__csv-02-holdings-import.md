# Junie Task Log — CSV-02 Holdings Import Service

Date: 2025-12-16  
Mode: Brave  
Branch: feature/csv-2-holdings-import  
Owner: Junie (Claude Sonnet 4.5)

## 1. Goal
- Implement CSV holdings import service with model extensions to enable local-first portfolio data for virtual family office internship simulations.

## 2. Context
- PRD CSV-02 requires extending the Holding model with additional fields (unrealized_gl, acquisition_date, ytm, maturity_date, disclaimers, source enum, import_timestamp, source_institution) and implementing a CsvHoldingsImporter service to parse JPM CSV files.
- This enables mocking investment positions for privacy modes supporting $20-50M families' educational simulations.
- Links to PRD: knowledge_base/prds/PRD CSV-02.md
- Follows pattern from existing CsvAccountsImporter service.

## 3. Plan
1. Create task log file
2. Create git branch: feature/csv-2-holdings-import
3. Create migration for new Holding fields (unrealized_gl, acquisition_date, ytm, maturity_date, disclaimers, source, import_timestamp, source_institution)
4. Update unique index to include source field (account_id + security_id + source)
5. Update Holding model with source enum, validations, and formatting methods
6. Create CsvHoldingsImporter service (app/services/csv_holdings_importer.rb)
7. Add rake task: csv:import_holdings[file_path,user_id]
8. Create test fixture CSV with 5-10 rows
9. Write unit tests for Holding model (source enum, new fields)
10. Write integration tests for CsvHoldingsImporter service
11. Run tests and fix any issues
12. Update task log with outcomes
13. Commit changes

## 6. Commands Run
Record commands that were run locally/CI and their outcomes.  
Use placeholders for any sensitive arguments.

```bash
# Create git branch
git checkout -b feature/csv-2-holdings-import

# Generate migration
rails generate migration AddCsvFieldsToHoldings

# Run migration
rails db:migrate

# Run tests
rails test test/models/holding_test.rb test/services/csv_holdings_importer_test.rb
# Result: 41 runs, 146 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```

## 7. Tests
Record tests that were run and results.

**Unit Tests (Holding Model):**
- ✅ 24 tests passing including:
  - Source enum with plaid/csv values
  - Source defaults to plaid
  - Uniqueness scoped to account_id + security_id + source
  - Same security_id allowed for different sources
  - CSV fields (unrealized_gl, acquisition_date, ytm, maturity_date, disclaimers, source_institution, import_timestamp)
  - Disclaimers JSON parsing
  - Conditional validations (symbol, quantity, market_value required for CSV)

**Integration Tests (CsvHoldingsImporter Service):**
- ✅ 17 tests passing including:
  - Import valid holdings from CSV
  - Link holdings to correct account via mask
  - Map CSV fields correctly (all field mappings verified)
  - Parse datetime fields (MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS format)
  - Parse decimal values with currency symbols and commas
  - Map asset class to type (equity→stock, fixed income→fixed_income)
  - Skip rows with zero quantity
  - Skip footer rows
  - Set source to csv for all imported holdings
  - Fail if file does not exist
  - Fail if account not found by mask
  - Handle malformed CSV
  - Update existing holding on re-import
  - Allow same security_id from different sources
  - Handle empty CSV gracefully
  - Extract mask from various filename formats

**Coverage:** 41 tests, 146 assertions, 100% pass rate

## 8. Decisions & Rationale
Document key decisions and why they were made.

- Decision: Drop existing unique index and create new one with account_id + security_id + source
    - Rationale: Database-level enforcement ensures CSV and Plaid holdings can coexist without conflicts
    - Alternatives considered: Model-level validation only (rejected for weaker enforcement)

- Decision: Map Asset Class to type, Asset Strategy Detail to subtype
    - Rationale: Leverages existing schema fields without concatenation or new columns
    - Alternatives considered: Concatenation (rejected for query complexity), ignore detail (rejected for lost granularity)

- Decision: Create cash holdings without updating Account balances
    - Rationale: Avoids duplication risks; balance reconciliation can be added later if needed
    - Alternatives considered: Update balances (rejected for complexity), skip cash rows (rejected for incomplete data)

- Decision: Use existing institution_price and institution_price_as_of fields
    - Rationale: Aligns with current schema, avoids migration complexity
    - Alternatives considered: Add new price_as_of field (rejected as redundant)

- Decision: Require account to exist (fail if not found)
    - Rationale: Assumes CSV-3 (accounts import) runs first; avoids orphan holdings
    - Alternatives considered: Auto-create account (rejected for orphan risks)

## 9. Risks / Tradeoffs
- Risk: Dropping unique index may cause brief window where duplicates could be inserted during migration
    - Mitigation: Use transaction block in migration; run during low-traffic period
- Risk: CSV format changes from JPM could break parser
    - Mitigation: Robust error handling with detailed logging; document expected format
- Tradeoff: Minimal test fixture (5-10 rows) vs full CSV testing
    - Mitigation: Reference full 6002.csv in manual testing notes

## 10. Follow-ups
Use checkboxes.

- [ ] Queue FinancialSnapshotJob after import (deferred to separate task)
- [ ] Add UI for CSV uploads (CSV-4)
- [ ] Generalize for Schwab/Amex/Stellar CSVs (future)
- [ ] Add RLS for multi-tenant security (RLS-1)
- [ ] Consider bulk insert optimization for >100 rows

## 11. Outcome
✅ **SUCCESS** - CSV Holdings Import Service fully implemented and tested.

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ Extended Holding model with 8 new fields (unrealized_gl, acquisition_date, ytm, maturity_date, disclaimers, source, import_timestamp, source_institution)
- ✅ Added source enum (plaid=0, csv=1) with default to plaid
- ✅ Updated unique index to account_id + security_id + source (allows CSV alongside Plaid)
- ✅ Created CsvHoldingsImporter service with robust CSV parsing, field mapping, and error handling
- ✅ Added rake task: `rake csv:import_holdings[file_path,user_id]`
- ✅ Created test fixture with 7 rows (5 valid, 1 zero quantity, 1 footer)
- ✅ Wrote 41 comprehensive tests (24 model + 17 service) - all passing
- ✅ Handles JPM CSV format with proper type mapping, datetime parsing, and decimal formatting
- ✅ Supports re-import (updates existing holdings by security_id + source)
- ✅ Allows same security_id from different sources (Plaid vs CSV)

**Usage:**
```bash
# Import holdings from CSV file
rake csv:import_holdings['/path/to/6002.csv',user_id]
```

**Next Steps:**
- Ready for manual testing with full 6002.csv file
- Ready for code review and merge to main
- Follow-up tasks tracked in section 10
